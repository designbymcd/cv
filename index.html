        <p><em><strong> STEAM Teacher</strong> at <a href="https://www.scarsdaleschools.k12.ny.us">Scarsdale High School</a></em></p>
        <p>For the past seven years, Brian has been working to combine the worlds of engineering, design thinking, and entrepreneurship in the classroom. Earning his Bachelors of Science in Technology Education from SUNY Oswego, he gained the hands-on
          experience of fabrication, material processing, and manufacturing. After graduating, Brian created a pre-engineering program for Rhinebeck Central School District, engaging middle and high school students in hands-on, project based learning using
          the national STEM curriculum, Project Lead the Way. Four years later he moved his talents to Scarsdale High School, where he has worked collaboratively to design a cohesive, authentic, and experiential STEAM program. Utilizing his Masters degree
          in Humanistic and Multicultural Education, Brian has integrated experiential learning and self-reflection into his STEAM courses, giving students the opportunity to master empathy, compassion, and self-reflection. The success of his STEAM program
          has gained international recognition, being the recipient of the 2019 STEMX Curriculum Design Award.</td>
